Hello Lovely Adies!


These are the Linux Workshop lesson notes and quick reference guide from our January 2025 LLL.

Hopefully this will be easier to get to than Google Drive.

Overview:
---------
This workshop is designed to help Adies who aren't yet familiar with the Linux command line
to overcome anxiety and fear associated with a blinking cursor on an otherwise empty screen.

In this workshop, we reviewed the most frequently used commands used by Linux adminstrators and 
developers alike.  With some practice, you can sit down at a terminal session and feel right at
home.

Key to the Learning Files: 

There are 5 files we'll use besides this one, and numbered in order of usage:

-   00-Play With Docker Instructions.pdf ......... How to log onto one of Docker's Linux sessions
